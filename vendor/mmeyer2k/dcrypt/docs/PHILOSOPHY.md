# Philosophy

- Use PHP's native functions instead of polyfills
- Require no external dependencies
- Use strong typing and strict type enforcement over type-checking conditional code
- Make source as simple as possible to audit
- Prefer clarity over backwards compatibility
- Lowest possible SLOC to achieve goals
- Iterate often to obtain perfection
